# Automata Simulator
Simulates a Deterministic Finite Automata

## Technologies
HTML5 Canvas and ES6 Javascript. No frameworks or external 3rd party technologies were used. 

## Config:
There is work in progress to create a UI that allows setup of the DFA. As for now, it simply reads in a config file called "fa_config.json". It takes this file and converts it into a DFA.

## Upcoming:
1. Create a UI to add and remove states and transitions as the simulator is running. 
2. Add support for NFAs and Epsilon NFAs.
